  <h1> The Mclean HS Innocence Club  </h1>

  <h2> What are we about? </h2>

  <p> Thousands of people in the United States have been wrongfully convicted for crimes they did not commit. The incarceration of these innocent people mean
  not only deterioration to their mental and physical healths but also the loss of, if not years,  decades of their lives. The innocence club tries to spread awareness 
  about these people, especially those individuals who were not subject to unjust cases or investigations, and advocate for the legal system to give reconsideration.  </p>

  <h2> The main FACTS </h2>
  
  <p> Exoneration's legal definition refers to the absolution and release of a person who was wrongfully convicted due to the finding or discovery
  of new evidence that proves their innocence. </p>
  <p>The United States has overseen 3500 exonerations since 1989</p>
  <p>More than 50% of wrongful convictions involve misused or mishandled forensic evidence. </p>
  <p>False confessions, racial bias, prejudice and flawed trials are still common.</p>
